# Streamlining Multi-Speciality Hospital Processes With Robotic Process Automation
This repository contains the code for automating hospital processes using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) with UiPath and a website for managing hospital activities.

## UiPath XAML Files
The UiPath XAML Files folder contains XAML files for various hospital processes that can be automated using UiPath. The processes include appointment scheduling, patient registration, prescription generation, lab test management, and billing. Each XAML file has a detailed explanation of the process it automates.

### Requirements
UiPath Studio or UiPath Community Edition installed on your machine.
### Usage
1. Open UiPath Studio or UiPath Community Edition.
2. Open the XAML file you want to use.
3. Run the process.
## Website Files
The Website Files folder contains HTML, CSS, and JS files for a website that can be used to manage hospital activities. The website has a login page and based on the email ID entered, it opens the appropriate home page for the user. There are home pages for patients, doctors, lab technicians, pharmacists, and receptionists. Each home page has a navigation menu that leads to the profile page, appointment booking page, and log out option.

### Usage
1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
2. Use the login page to enter email ID and log in.
3. The website will direct you to the appropriate home page based on your role in the hospital.
4. Use the navigation menu to access various features of the website.
